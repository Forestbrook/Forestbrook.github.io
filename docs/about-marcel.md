# About Marcel Wolterbeek

_Complexity is your enemy. Any fool can make something complicated. It is hard to keep things simple._ - **Richard Branson**

Writing professional, clean, and simple code is my passion. I was born on a small ecological farm near Amsterdam. As a _eenvoudige boerenzoon_ (simple farmers son)
I like to keep code simple.

I started to study Forestry at Wageningen University. Soon I found out that Forestry was not exactly my cup of tea. I switched to Business Economics and managed to get a Masters degree (drs.) at the VU University Amsterdam.
