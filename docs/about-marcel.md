_“Complexity is your enemy. Any fool can make something complicated. It is hard to keep things simple.”_ - **Richard Branson**

Writing professional, clean, and simple code is my passion. I was born on a small ecological farm near Amsterdam. As a _“eenvoudige boerenzoon”_ (simple farmers son)
I like to keep code simple.

I started to study Forestry at Wageningen University. Soon I found out that Forestry was not exactly my cup of tea.
I switched to Business Economics and managed to get a Masters degree (drs.) at the VU University Amsterdam.

During my study I had to do some programming (C and eh… Cobol) and I started to like it.
I could take Software Engineering as an optional course at the department of Computer Science
and I decided to specialize in Software Development after my study.

I started with Mobile Development in 1998, when cellphones were more like bricks.
Actually the first device I was programming had the nickname “the axe”, which was a mobile terminal with a matrix (!) printer included.
It was used by cash transportation companies in several countries to keep track of all the details, 
print collect/delivery receipts and transfer the data to the back-end system. All that I had to cram into a Z80 processor with 16kB memory…
