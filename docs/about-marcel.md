## A bit of history

I live in Amsterdam, (Netherlands) with my wife and two sons (10 and 4). I was born on a small ecological farm [on the bottom of a lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlemmermeer){:target="_blank"}. As an _eenvoudige boerenzoon_ I like to keep code simple!

After High School I started to study Forestry at Wageningen University. Soon I found out that Forestry was not exactly my cup of tea. I switched to Business Economics and managed to get a Masters degree (drs.) at the VU University Amsterdam.

During my study I had to do some programming (C and eh... Cobol) and I started to like it. I could take Software Engineering as an optional course at the department of Computer Science and I decided to specialize in Software Development after my study.

I started with Mobile Development in 1998, when cellphones were more like bricks. Actually, the first device I was programming had the nickname _the axe_, which was a mobile terminal with a matrix (!) printer included. It was used by cash transportation companies in several countries to keep track of all the details, print collect/delivery receipts and transfer the data to the back-end system. All that I had to cram into a Z80 processor with 16 KB memory...

## Hire me

You can hire me just to help you to get started, to help with a complex part of a solution or for a project where you need a specialist in my area. I'm well prepared to do my work remote, but if you are located in (or close to) Amsterdam, The Netherlands, I can help you on-site if you want to. I'm committed to a long-term relationship with my customers, even when you only need me occasionally. I can:

- Help you to migrate your .NET solutions to Microsoft Azure.
- Help to setup your Azure and Azure DevOps environment efficiently, including CI/CD.
- Help you upgrade to ASP.NET Core 6.
- Help you getting started with Blazor.
- Help you getting started with Xamarin or to smooth out a stalled Xamarin project.
- Help to build Xamarin and/or Blazor components.
- Help you when you need a specialist in my area for a shorter or longer period.
